Purpose
-----

This study was an exploratory data analysis of 1987 crime statistics for a selection of 90 countries in North Carolina. The objective was to understand the key determinants of crime and provide policy recommendations to local government. (OLS) Regression was used to examine the data and explore correlational and potentially causal relationships between crime rate (outcome variable) and a set of 25 explanatory variables from the following categories:

- certainty of punishment
- severity of punishment
- location
- population density and demographics of the counties
- taxes and weekly wages
